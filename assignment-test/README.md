1. Today was a disaster.

I started the homework late. I've been consistently completely my homework for this class on Mondays just fine. Well not today.

I am in the process of trying to sell my house for my parents, and the stress won today.
I spent some time watching the video, looking over the readings, and jumped in too quick. Because i didn't have a good enough grasp I was confused by your example and what the pdf was asking of us, and this it went to sh*t and I completely lost it.  I tried deleting everything and trying from scratch. Nope. I am quitting for today.

I am honestly surprised that it took me 14wks to become defeated, and I guess its just in time for finals.

2. I know I will have to work extra hard, and many days for the final project. I know that now after today.

3. last week was too easy, and reality smacked me in the face real good today.
