            Children are known to be resilient; however, parental conflict, in this case, a divorce, has been shown to have
            lasting adverse effects if handled poorly. This essay will discuss the known impact of divorce and parental
            conflict on children; furthermore, co-parenting and educational classes will be addressed. Through clinical
            observation and research, professionals have agreed that divorce does not have to be detrimental to a family
            dynamic when adults are willing to work towards civility and put their children's wellbeing first.

        <div class="second-paragraph">
            According to the article by Martínez-pampliega et al. (2015), nasty divorces have psychological and psychosomatic
            effects on children. This means that children are experiencing mental symptoms that cause behavioral issues, anxiety,
            or depression, and that mental stress is popping up in physical symptoms. Children of divorce often struggle academically,
            withdraw from friends and activities, and even present aggressive behaviors (Martínez-pampliega et., 2015). Imagine a
            daily routine where both parents are in the home, it differs in households, but most married couples share responsibilities
            for the children. Suddenly, if joint custody is in place, one parent is holding all responsibility when the children are
            with them; the split of time between parents and the disruption will be a challenging adjustment. Parents who fight in front
            of children, use them as messengers, talk poorly about each other - this is too much to ask a child to process healthily
            (Ferraro et al., 2016). No parent wants to cause this kind of stress in their children, but some don't have the tools to
            implement healthy co-parenting techniques.

            Co-parenting works best when there is a high level of cooperation and low level of conflict between parents; educational
            programs help divorced parents learn communication techniques and separate issues between parents from raising their kids
            the best they can (Ferraro et al., 2016). Many couples choose to have a divorce mediator; not only can they help with
            general issues and legal matters, but many can walk you through a parenting plan. Having a consistent schedule is very
            important for children, especially with something as life-changing as this. Parenting plans include weekly schedules, who
            get the kids what days, which is responsible for what activities and contingency plans; holidays and special occasions
            are also decided upon this time.
        </div>
        <div>
            If civility and healthy communication can occur, co-parents should still share time with the family; birthdays, school
            performances, and extracurriculars. However, if the adults cannot remain civil and be good role models for the children,
            it may be best to have some separation directly after divorce. The process of divorce is difficult for all members of
            the family. It is essential to go into the process openminded with humility and forgiveness. Remind your children that it
            is never their fault, and you both will continue to love them unconditionally.
