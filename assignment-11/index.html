            Co-parenting works best when there is a high level of cooperation and low level of conflict between parents; educational
            programs help divorced parents learn communication techniques and separate issues between parents from raising their kids
            the best they can (Ferraro et al., 2016). Many couples choose to have a divorce mediator; not only can they help with
            general issues and legal matters, but many can walk you through a parenting plan. Having a consistent schedule is very
            important for children, especially with something as life-changing as this. Parenting plans include weekly schedules, who
            get the kids what days, which is responsible for what activities and contingency plans; holidays and special occasions
            are also decided upon this time.

            If civility and healthy communication can occur, co-parents should still share time with the family; birthdays, school
            performances, and extracurriculars. However, if the adults cannot remain civil and be good role models for the children,
            it may be best to have some separation directly after divorce. The process of divorce is difficult for all members of
            the family. It is essential to go into the process openminded with humility and forgiveness. Remind your children that it
            is never their fault, and you both will continue to love them unconditionally.
