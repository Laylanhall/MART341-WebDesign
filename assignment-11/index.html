        <div class="opening-paragraph">
        "There is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you discover your father is a man-with human flesh."
        -from "Collected Sayings of Mauad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan."
        </div>
        <div class="second-paragraph">
          <p>"The Duke Said: "Paul, I'm doing a hateful thing, but I must." He stood beside the portable poison snooper that had been brought into the
          confernce room for their breakfast.</p> <p>The thing's sensor arms humg limply over the table, reminding Paul of some weird insect newly dead.
          The Duke's attention was directed out the windows at the landing field and its roiling of dust against the morning sky.
          Paul had a viewer in front of him containing a short filmclip on Fremen religious practices. The clip had been compiled by one of Hawat's
          experts and Paul found himself disturbed by the references to himself.</p>
          <p>"Mahdi!"</p>
          <p>"Lisan al-Gaib!"</p>
          <p> He could close his eyes and recall the shouts of the crowds. So that is what they hope, he thought. And he remembered what the old Reverend
          Mother had said: Kwisatz Haderach. The memories touched his feelings of terrible purpose, shading this stange world with sensations of
          familiarity that he could not understand.</p>
          <p>"A hateful thing," the Duke Said.</p>
          <p>"What do you mean, sir?"</p>
          <p>Leto turned, looked down at his son. "Because the Harkonnens think to trick me by making me distrust your mother. they don't know that I'd sonner
          distrust myself."</p>
          <p>"I don't understand, sir."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="third-paragraph">
            <p>Again, Leto looked out the the windows. The white sun was well up into its morning quadrant. Milky light picked out a boiling of dust clouds that spilled
            over into the blind canyons interfingering the Shield Wall.</p>
            <p>Slowly, speaking in a low voice to contain his anger, the Duke explained to Paul about the mysterious note.</p>
            <p>"You might just as well mistrust me," Paul said.</p>
            <p>"They have to think they've succeded," the Duke said. "They must think me this much a fool. It must look real. Even your mother may not know the sham."</p>
            <p>"But, Sir! Why?"</p>
            <p>"Your mother's response must not be an act. Oh, she's capable of a supreme act...but too much rides on this. I hope to smoke out a traitor. It must seem
              that I've been completely cozened. She must be hurt this way that she does not suffer greater hurt."</p>
