- system font: these are the ones already available on your computer or such. Issue is that these may not be licensed for web use.
- web-font: These are custom to a server, and require a special element to appear. You have to worry about compatibility, render speeds, and access.
- web-safe font: These are the trusty steeds of the font world. They typically won't let you down, you can relax knowing a variety of users (Windows and Mac alike) will be able to enjoy your creation.

3. I mostly had a hard time figuring what writing to use. I was going to use one of my short essays but then I would have had the linking issue, and what would I put for that etc. So I went with the book DUNE. Which I read in a syfy class but really enjoyed. It took me a couple of hours to decide on the fonts to use, along with complimentary colors. I went back and forth a lot. Other than that I think this week went well.
