1. My Imaginary client was a blogger obsessed with Tiny Houses. They wanted a simple website where they could discuss designs, materials, builders etc. They desired a dropdown with links that would lead their readers to three of their favorite tiny house builders.

2. Mobile-first design is important in this day in age because the majority of website users are viewing it on their smart phone's. Accessability is most important.

3. My biggest challenge this week was getting my image sizes right. I discovered I had my size definition at percent not pixels. once I got that squared away things started looking less blurry. It was pretty frustrating for awhile until then though.
- Sometimes the style css gives me trouble just because there is so much to it. but nothing feels better when you click 'open in browser' and the majority of your version comes to life. A few tweaks here and there are no problem!
