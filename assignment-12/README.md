- Padding: is the amount of space between content and border.
- Margins: are what go around your box, for instance, it is the outer layer of the border which interacts with things on the rest of the page.
- Borders: unlike the others, it can be colored differently and styled differently than the content within or surrounding it. Border width, style, and color are its options                                                                       
2. I had a bit of trouble with trying to get a solid background on my page. Then
I remembered I could write in a background color specifically for html in css.
And wah-la, up popped the color. I also struggled with placing the images where
I wanted them. I eventually deleted one because it didn't look right.  I wish I
could do more, and change things around. But I may un do something I won't have time to
redue.
