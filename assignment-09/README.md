1. I am beginning to feel more comfortable with html. The structural side I am pretty confident with, but I am still getting used to the semantic html. Nine weeks seems like a long time, but now that I am literally started from scratch on a new skill, I would be willing to embark on trying things that take longer to learn. None of it has been easy, but problem solving on my own is a lot of fun.
2. Styling does worry me a bit. Looking at professional websites, and how creative they can be, makes me wonder if I can come up with interesting styles that don't clash. I don't mind simplicity, but I don't want to be boring either.
3. Now that I have got atom to open my code in a browser, it is much easier and quicker to problem solve in real time. I don't have to go back and forth as much from the lessons to my work to see if it's correct or not.
