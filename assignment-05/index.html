Alec spends all day and night following clues to find him; he runs into the<br>
owner who comments on the wildness of the horse and says he needs to be<br>
trained. The boy talks him into helping him, and they come to discover how fast<br>
fast the horse his. The train him as a racehorse but because he has no papers<br>
the only way he could compete would be a match-race. The ending of the story<br>
