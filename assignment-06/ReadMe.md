Semantic markup is used to place emphasis on certain parts of info in a document. Bold, underline, italicize etc.

I read online people with macs have trouble using atom with this newer version and I have to install an older one and then block updates?? There is no preview button to select and ctrl shift h doesn't do anything. Markdown doesn't work on html... at least not in atom on my computer.
In fact, I can't get markdown preview to work on ANY of my files from any
assignments in this repository right now. I just tried them all. ugh
