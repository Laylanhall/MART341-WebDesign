- Well, seeing how I new nothing about wed development, Github, version control, or repositories before this class I feel like I have a 100% increase in knowledge on the subject now.

- I didn't think I would like Github after the first day, but it has grown on me. To not knowing anything about code to using Atom and building something that looks like a simple website is crazy!

- I did enjoy learning the details of wed design, the relationship of layout, font, and color. How to make it easiest for visitors to use the site, complementary colors and fonts. I learned I liked to problem solve (except when I mess it up so bad I just have to delete it all and start again).

- Right now, I am having trouble with the dropdown menu on my website. I've gotten them to work before but this one isn't taking to it. So I asked for help. I will continue my search and see if I can figure it out before tomorrow.
