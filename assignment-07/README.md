# Homework
1. Form controls need name="" attributes. Input elements seen on the web collect data, for instance when I log into my moodle using my username and password. the data is collected then sent to the designated server.
Input elements helps the form element be more specific - example: <input type="text" name="username" id="username_input" /> we have type, name and identification here. the data can be sent the server or accessed in javascript through a users computer.



2. 
**Text:**
<textarea name="comments" id="test textarea">Enter up to 300 characters...</textarea>. Users are able to put longer responses in the field element.
**Selection:**
<input type="checkbox" name="service" value="lab" /> Writing Lab. Users can select or deselect or choose from a sequential set of options.
**Button:**
<form action="example"  method="post"> <p>example email</p> <input type="text" name="email" /> <input type="submit" name="subscribe" value="Subscribe" /> </form>
The form is sent to a server; lesson example is a subscription to an email list, enter your email and it gets sent to a server which then (does a fancy thing) and you get emails from their subscription.

I am still having trouble with my "style" in html. I downloaded three different types of browser packages and none of them are showing a background color. I have waited over 1/2 hr and browser shows other changes I make accept for
style media="color" body {background:blue; etc.} I made sure I chose the media style tag too, still nothing. otherwise i think the rest of the homework went fine.
